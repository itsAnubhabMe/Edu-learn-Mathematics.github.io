        <p class="secsubtag text-small">In contemporary education, mathematics education is the practice of teaching and learning mathematics, along with the associated scholarly research.

            Researchers in mathematics education are primarily concerned with the tools, methods and approaches that facilitate practice or the study of practice; however, mathematics education research, known on the continent of Europe as the didactics or pedagogy of mathematics, has developed into an extensive field of study, with its concepts, theories, methods, national and international organisations, conferences and literature. This article describes some of the history, influences and recent controversies.</p>

        <p class="sectag text-big">Transforming Education in India</p>
        <p class="secsubtag text-small">At the outset, let me thank my readers for the encouragement and appreciation received for my first two articles. I am excited to see the interest of a lot of friends and peers in the Impact Investing space and the core idea to start my blog was in fact to demystify this space a bit and light that spark. Glad to see the efforts creating some change!

            So I was travelling the past two weeks across South and North India to visit some of my portfolio companies. I was deliberating on what topic to write on this week when I decided why not share my on ground visit experience with two of our most promising portfolio companies in the education sector- Ignis Careers and Vikalp India.
            
            I am sure most of us are already aware of the appalling state of education in India. While the gross enrollment ratio has steadily risen, the learning outcomes have been inversely proportional to it. Nearly 67% of children cannot do basic arithmetic while more than 75% of them are behind in at least one or more grade in math. 50% of the 5th class students cannot read a 2nd class English textbook as per a survey by ASER. In the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a global study undertaken by OECD which measures 15 year old pupils’ performance on math, science and English, India’s rank stood 72/ 73rd in the last test taken in 2009. It has avoided taking it subsequently in 2012 and 2015 to avoid further public ignominy and global shame. In September 2017, World Bank also warned of a ‘learning crisis’ in global education and mentioned that schooling without learning was not just a wasted development opportunity, but also a great injustice to children and young people worldwide and is creating a moral and economic crisis.</p>

        <p class="secsubtag text-small">The brochure is intended for parents and adults who consider that quality development of pre-school children is important. It shows life in the kindergarten, the way it’s organized and the importance of kindergarten. The games and activities that are used in working with children are described and they can be applied by the family as well.

            The brochure contains interesting data on the characteristics of children, i.e. what children can and should show in each year from birth to school. In addition to the characteristics of child development, pedagogical lessons that encourage this development are also offered. Special attention is paid to possible difficulties that may occur occasionally or over a longer period of time.</p>
